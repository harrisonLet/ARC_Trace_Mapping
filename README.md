This project visualizes data from the Utah Summer Ozone Study (USOS) 2024, conducted by NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Laboratory (CSL).
The study focused on measuring ozone and its precursors in the Salt Lake City, Utah, region during the summer months (15 July – 18 August 2024).

The Wasatch Front region, home to over 2.5 million people, regularly experiences exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. This project uses mobile laboratory data collected via the ARC (Air Resources Car) vehicle to map the spatial
distribution of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other pollutants.
